The main window is divided into two sections:
	Right sections is some information for the user, such as what is the purpose of application / how passwords are generated and a little guidance on how to generate the password

	The left section requires user involvement. User chooses the length of the password (it should be between 6 and 20 characters long) and presses '**GO**' button. After it is done, a random password appears:

In order to easily copy password to the clipboard user can press the '**COPY**' button.

A bit further down there are a few more buttons, which extends applications functionality.
	The first one is '**Save to DB**', which evokes a new window:

User is asked for the attributes that will be stored inside the Database. If all the fields are filled succesfully and not left blank, the password is stored safely inside the storage. If some of the fields are left blank user is shown an error message:

	Another option that is presented to the user is under the '**Show DB**' button, which opens up a new window, with passwords stored inside the database (all passwords shown are just for demonstration purposes):

	And the last functionality can be accessed when '**Edit DB**' button is pressed:

New window appears, which lets user either update information or delete stored information. It should be used as it follows:
	Firstly user searches for ID, under which the information is stored, if entry is found it is displayed,

	otherwise, an error message pops up:

from there user can either update:

or delete entry:

completely wiping it off of the database:

Overall the program should be used only for personal used as it is not protected by a master password.
